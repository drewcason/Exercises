        <p>Katelyn and Josh were married on top of Mt. Everest as you can plainly see. Everyone wore their most potent
            sunscreen due to the thin atmosphere. Braving the cold, Katelyn chose to wear a dress in lieu of several
            layers of winter coats. She is now frozen solid. Josh was smart and wore a jacket. He is not currently
            frozen.</p>

            <p>This is one of my favorite image before the frostbite really set in.
                Notice that all fingers are still accounted for and their desperate attempt to stay warm by cozying up
                to each other. Unfortunatley, they were unsucessful and evetually froze.

            <p>Check out this dope cake and cheap beer. All of the drunk people thought they were delicious. They also
                enjoyed hunting squirrels, throwing pine cones, and starting forest fires. Smokey was not invited and
                tweeted the couple at 2:00AM.
