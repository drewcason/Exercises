    <p>Now this is a story all about how
        My life got flipped turned upside down
        And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there
        I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air
        
        In West Philadelphia born and raised
        On the playground is where I spent most of my days
        Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool
        And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
        When a couple of guys who were up to no good
        Started making trouble in my neighborhood
        I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
        And said "You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"</p>

    <p>I don't want to grow up. I want to be a Toys R Us kid because I'm rolling down the street sipping on gin an juice with my mind on my money and my money on my mind.</p>
